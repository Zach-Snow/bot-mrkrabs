# Mr. Krabs Bot

Please use the main branch as the interim-branch is the one being worked on and sometimes might not work cause of unfinished work. 

First, Keep in mind that this is a work in progress.

This repository contains code for the MS teams bot I am currently develoing using  [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework.

The primary activity for the bot is to issue penalty to a person in question. It can also show some reports related to the person as well. It has some predefined penalty types but new ones can be added. PostgreSQL is being used for the database side of things. IntelliJ Idea is being used as the IDE for the project. This is a java springboot app. 
 
To test the bot [Microsoft BotFramework emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/tag/v4.12.0) is needed.
