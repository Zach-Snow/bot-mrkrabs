# Mr. Krabs Bot

This repository contains code for the MS teams bot I am currently develoing using  [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework.

The primary activity for the bot is to issue penalty to a person in question. It has some predefined penalty types but new ones can be added. PostgreSQL is being used for the database side of things. IntelliJ Idea is being used as the IDE for the project. This is a java springboot app. 
 
 To test the bot [Microsoft BotFramework emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/tag/v4.12.0) is needed.
